It seems you have found my website! While I temporarily have control over your fleeting attention, let me tell you a little about myself.

I am a PhD student in the [Math department at the University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/phd-students/jblarsen.html), co-advised by [Shravan Veerapaneni](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/faculty/shravan.html) and [Paul Zimmerman](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/zimmerman-lab/). I am both a [DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/profile/larsen2023) and a [MICDE Fellow](https://micde.umich.edu/member/james-larsen/). My research focuses on leveraging neural networks to understand ground state properties of molecules at scale.
